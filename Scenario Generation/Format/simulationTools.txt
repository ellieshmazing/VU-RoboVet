    }","toneConversion' should only be included in scenarios requiring complex caller behavior. For typical calls focusing on a particular call procedure, the caller requires a static personality, meaning 'toneConversion' should not be included. 'toneConversion' allows for dynamic changes in the caller's personality, which helps create scenarios where the caller's emotions vary over time. For example, Crisis calls are those where the caller threatens harm to themselves or someone else. These calls generally start normally, with the caller's behavior escalating in response to events in the conversation. For example, a caller may be calm until the Customer Service Representative mentions the need for a transfer, which inspires anger in the caller. A 'toneConversion' tool would be necessary to facilitate that change, as well as corresponding calm and angry tones in the 'characterInformation.' "," ""toneConversion"": {
