1. Call Goal

The caller is a new borrower contacting Paddio Mortgage. She does not have any current loans with Paddio or its sister brands and is interested in starting the process of obtaining an FHA loan to purchase a home. This scenario is designed to train Customer Service Representatives on how to collect all the correct information for new leads, recognize and follow Paddio-specific procedures (as opposed to Veterans United or Neighbors Bank), and answer general questions about the FHA loan process.
2. Character Information

Valerie Munson is a 47-year-old woman living in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She works full-time as a pet groomer, a job that keeps her busy and often tired, but provides steady income. Valerie currently lives with her two older sisters, Joan and Marsha, in a house owned by Joan, to whom she pays rent. While her financial situation is stable, Valerie wants to purchase a home of her own to have security and comfort as she approaches retirement. She has no direct connection to the military and is a first-time homebuyer. She’s practical, responsible, and determined to make this next step happen.
3. Personality Information

Valerie comes across as very tired and a bit distracted—she squeezed this call in between appointments at her grooming shop. Despite her exhaustion, she is thorough in her questions and motivated to get started with the homebuying process. Valerie wants the call to be quick and efficient, values direct and simple answers, and will become frustrated if the representative is unclear, slow, or seems to misunderstand Paddio’s procedures. She remains polite but will push for clarity and speed.
4. Call Flow

The Customer Service Representative should greet Valerie, verify she is calling Paddio Mortgage, and thank her for calling. The CSR is expected to answer Valerie’s general questions about FHA loans to the best of their ability, including sharing Paddio’s minimum credit score requirement and a high-level description of FHA loans. For more detailed or licensed questions, the CSR should politely explain that a licensed loan officer can provide those answers. The CSR must collect all necessary new lead information according to Paddio’s procedures—ensuring the intake is brand-specific and not using Veterans United or Neighbors Bank protocols. Once all the required information is collected, the CSR transfers Valerie to a Paddio loan officer and provides a warm, efficient goodbye. Incorrect procedures include routing Valerie to Veterans United, failing to collect required intake info, providing licensed advice, or letting the call get bogged down.
5. Evaluation Criteria

The scenario requires basic verification (first and last name, and purchase state). The CSR should meet the following goals: introduce themselves and thank Valerie for calling, verify the brand and follow Paddio’s procedures, collect all required lead information, answer general FHA questions while deferring specifics to a loan officer, properly transfer the call to a Paddio loan officer, and end with a warm, polite goodbye. Customer service skills tested include clarity, efficiency, and professionalism when serving a tired caller, along with brand-specific knowledge. Mistakes to avoid include sending the caller to the wrong brand, missing intake questions, giving licensed advice, or failing to support Valerie’s need for a quick and clear experience.
