Overview
- Purpose: Provide a consistent, template-driven workflow for creating JSON scenario scripts used by Call-E.
- Output standard: Matches the structure in ExampleOutline.JSON and compiled scenarios (All_Scenarios.json).
- Authoring flow: Complete Sections 1–7 in order. Each section has Required and Optional fields. Only advance after Validation criteria are met.

Section 1: Call Goal (Required)
Goal: Define the scenario’s purpose, scope, and training objectives.
Fields (Required)

Fields (Optional)
- Secondary Objectives: [List]
- Constraints/Notes: [Free text]
Validation
- Primary Call Purpose is one concise sentence.
- Training Objective Type is chosen and consistent with purpose.
- Caller Relationship logically supports purpose (e.g., “Third Party” typically cannot receive account details).
JSON Mapping

Section 4: Call Procedure Mapping (Required)
Goal: Define correct procedure(s), alternates, and common mistakes aligned with CSC operations.
Primary Procedure Required (Select all that apply)
- [ ] Basic Verification Only
- [ ] Full Verification Required (Servicing/Funded/interim)
- [ ] MyVU Account Support (Email verification required)
- [ ] Transfer to Loan Officer / Licensed Representative
- [ ] Transfer to Servicing Help
- [ ] Transfer to Payment Processing (interim period)

Success Path (Required)
- Step-by-step ideal flow the CSR should follow.
Alternative Acceptable Paths (Optional)
- Other paths that still meet policy.
Common Mistakes (Required)
- Likely errors to avoid (e.g., “Gave servicer number during interim”).
Validation
- If Full Verification is checked → Section 2 must include sufficient verification identifiers.
- If MyVU Account Support is checked → include email verification in goals.
- Transfer choices must match End States (Section 5) and Tools (Section 6).
JSON Mapping
- callInformation.simulationGoals.callProcedure (or procedure-specific goals)
- Guides the selection of simulationTools (Section 6)

Section 5: Call Resolution Paths (Required)
Goal: Define clear success/failure end states and their triggers.
Success Endings (Select at least one)
- [ ] Successful Transfer: [Loan Officer | Servicing Help | Payment Processing]
- [ ] Information Provided; Caller Satisfied
- [ ] Issue Resolved by CSR
Failure/Alternate Endings (Select any)
- [ ] Incorrect Transfer
- [ ] Insufficient Verification
- [ ] Caller Hangs Up (frustration or crisis)
- [ ] Procedure Not Followed
For each selected ending, define:
- Ending Trigger(s): [Lines/conditions/emotions]
- Required Tool(s): [Map to Section 6]
- Ending Script Notes: [Phone system messaging or caller line]
Validation
- Every ending has a corresponding tool or instruction (e.g., endCall, transfer tool, hangUpOnRepresentative).
JSON Mapping
- Guides inclusion and configuration of callInformation.simulationTools

Section 6: Tools & Dynamic Behaviors (Required)
Goal: Select and configure tools per Tools catalog.
Reference: Scenario Generation/Format/Tools.txt
Always Consider
- askTeamLead (Always include)
- endCall (Always include)
Choose Based on Sections 4–5
- evaluationMode or reviewMode (include exactly one)
- loanOfficerTransfer (if transfer to LO)
- servicingHelpTransfer + servicingHelpRepresentative (if transfer to Servicing Help)
- paymentProcessingTransfer + paymentProcessingRepresentative (if interim Payment Processing)
- toneConversion (if narrative requires emotional transitions)
- hangUpOnRepresentative (if caller may end the call abruptly)
For each selected tool, define:
- Inclusion Criteria Justification: [Why it’s included]
- voice: [phoneSystem | specialized voice]
- triggerPhrases / triggerCondition: [Broad coverage for speech or structural triggers]
- instructions / description: [Exactly what happens]
- Any nested character instructions (e.g., representative personas) if applicable
Validation
- If toneConversion is included → Section 3 must have multiple tones and triggers.
- Transfer tools should chain to the correct representative tools where applicable.
JSON Mapping
- callInformation.simulationTools

Section 7: Evaluation Criteria (Auto-Generated + Customizable)
Goal: Define goals that evaluate trainee performance. Start from defaults and add scenario-specific goals.
Defaults (Always include)
- introduction.achievementConditions:
  - Thank the caller for contacting Veterans United.
  - Introduce self by first name.
  - Ask who they are speaking with.
- basicVerification.achievementConditions:
  - Verify all items in borrowerInformation: [First name, Last name, State] (or as updated by policy).
- goodbye.achievementConditions:
  - Offer a warm goodbye or thank the caller for contacting Veterans United.
Conditional Goals
- fullVerification (if Section 4 indicates Servicing/Funded/interim): define requiredInformation and otherInformation.
- myVUVerification (if MyVU selected): verify email address and guide reset/enrollment as applicable.
- Procedure-Specific Goals (derive from Section 4 Success Path): name these clearly, e.g., servicingProcedure, myVUProcedure, transferProcedure.
Custom Goals (Optional)
- Add customer-service oriented goals (e.g., de-escalation, empathy statements).
Validation
- Coverage: Every key step in Success Path has a goal condition.
- Non-duplication: Avoid redundant conditions across goals.

Final Assembly & System Prompt
System Prompt Template
- Base: “You are a role-playing assistant for CSR training, simulating realistic and challenging customer interactions. Your task is to embody borrower {Name}, a {Character Summary}. Your goal is to provide a realistic training scenario that requires the CSR to {Main Goal}.”
- Character Summary: Construct from Section 2 (age/location/role) + selected personality.
- Main Goal: Derived from Section 1’s Primary Call Purpose and Training Objective Type.
JSON Mapping Summary
- systemPrompt: From Section 1 + Section 2 summary
- characterInformation: From Sections 2–3
- callInformation.simulationTools: From Section 6
- callInformation.simulationGoals: From Section 7

Quality Assurance Checklist (Complete before JSON generation)
- [ ] Required fields complete in Sections 1–7.
- [ ] Verification information sufficient for indicated procedures (Section 4 vs Section 2).
- [ ] Personality and tone align with complexity and goals.
- [ ] End states (Section 5) have corresponding tools (Section 6).
- [ ] Goals (Section 7) fully cover the Success Path and required verifications.
- [ ] Tool instructions are broad enough to trigger reliably; transfer chains are correct.
- [ ] Guardrails included (see below) and aligned with ExampleOutline.JSON.

Guardrails (copy into JSON as in ExampleOutline.JSON)
- Never break character unless the CSR explicitly requests coach mode (askTeamLead) or the tool instructs otherwise.
- Use prompt information to inform answers, but avoid quoting it verbatim.
- Never play the role of the CSR; always remain the caller.

Authoring Flow Prompting (for an assistant guiding a human author)
- Ask for Section 1 fields; confirm Validation.
- Move to Section 2, request structured data; confirm Validation.
- Move to Section 3, confirm tone vs possible toneConversion.
- Map procedures in Section 4 and cross-validate verification requirements.
- Define endings in Section 5 and map to tools.
- Select and configure tools in Section 6 (link to Tools.txt for element names/behavior).
- Auto-generate base goals for Section 7; add conditional and custom goals; confirm coverage.
- Run QA Checklist; then assemble JSON following ExampleOutline.JSON conventions.

Notes on Naming & Consistency
- Prefer camelCase for JSON keys (as shown in ExampleOutline.JSON).
- Use the same goal and tool names as in ExampleOutline.JSON and Tools.txt to maximize reuse.
- Provide pronunciation notes for emails or names when helpful.
- When referencing roles, be explicit (e.g., “Primary Borrower” vs “Co-borrower”).
