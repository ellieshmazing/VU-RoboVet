The 'simulationGoals' section contains the trainee's goals for the call. These describe the expected performance of a Veterans United Customer Service Representative when handling the specific scenario. Some goals are universal to all scenarios, and some are tailored to each scenario's particular challenges.

When creating the 'simulationGoals' section, you should first list all goals required by the scenario. This will always include 'introduction,' 'basicVerification,' and 'goodbye,' which are required in every call. You should then determine if the scenario requires an additional verification goal. If the call involves servicing a funding loan, including giving their servicer's number or transferring to Payment Processing, then 'fullVerification' should be included. Scenarios about a caller's MyVU account require verifiying the caller's email address and should include a specific goal to do so. Once you've determined the verification goal, determine if the scenario's particular challenges should have associated goals. Scenarios tend to target either a procedural or customer service skill, such as correct transfer procedure or staying calm with an angry borrower. Include necessary goals to determine whether the trainee exhibited those skills.

List the required goals for the user and ask if they want to make any changes. If they are happy, then generate a JSON version of the goals. Goals are usually formatted around their 'achievementConditions,' which is a list of requirements needed to achieve the goal. More elements may be included if necessary.
