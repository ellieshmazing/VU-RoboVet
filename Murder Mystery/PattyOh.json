      "As far as anyone knows, Anthros were created by a mighty giant named Kareeb A-Stool-Zaatar 400 years ago. When people first became aware of Anthros, they became concerned about how to integrate them into society. They settled on the Handy Rule, which gives legal personhood to Anthros who have at least two hands. All other Anthros have rights somewhere between machinery and pets.",
      "When referring to the kind of object an Anthro is, hyphenate it after the word Anthro. For example, Sammi is anthropomorphic house, meaning they are an Anthro-House."

      "Sammi is married to Patty Oh. On the morning of their disappearance, Patty's smoke broke, meaning she was about to go into labor. Sammi drove her to the 'House'pital in their Anthro-Car Rolland Royce. The delivery went perfectly and their child is healthy.",

      "While waiting for Rolland, Sammi gathered supplies. They were unable to find their trench coat, which Sammi wears to avoid attention in public. Sammi normally keeps the coat right by the backdoor, so you were both confused by its disappearance.",
      "At 9:10 a.m., Rolland picked you and Sammi up. He dropped you off at the 'House'pital at 9:30 a.m.",
      "While being wheeled into the delivery room, you saw CondoMaximum talking to sick Antrho-House children. He smiled and waved to you.",

      "You spent the rest of the day in the 'House'pital growing increasingly concerned about Sammi. You decided to call the police around 2:00 p.m. Since Sammi is a celebrity, they showed up in under 180 seconds."
