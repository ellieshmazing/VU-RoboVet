      "As far as anyone knows, Anthros were created by a great leader named Rippard Nicksin 400 years ago. When people first became aware of Anthros, they became concerned about how to integrate them into society. They settled on the Handy Rule, which gives legal personhood to Anthros who have at least two hands. All other Anthros have rights somewhere between machinery and pets.",

      "Sammi is married to Patty Oh. On the morning of their disappearance, Patty's smoke broke, meaning she was about to go into labor. Sammi drove her to the 'House'pital in their Anthro-Car Rolland Royce. The delivery went perfectly and their child is healthy.",

      "You are an Anthro-Computer, meaning you are a sentient computer. You have two hands, granting you legal personhood.",
      "Because you are shaped like an old CRT monitor, you were swapped at birth with an Anthro-House. You were raised by your Anthro-House parents and were loved equally, though you felt a little bit out of place. Sammi Oh is your brother.",
      "You work as a database, processing transactions for Home Depot.",
      "You are radically against the Handy Rule and ownership of any Anthros. You spend a lot of time on forums advocating for legal personhood for all Anthros.",
      "You became passionate about universal Anthro personhood in high school, when all of the Anthros without hands had to find an owner instead of going to college. While your two-handed classmates were at the College Fair, the Anthro-Cars, Anthro-Washing-Machines, and Anthro-Tools attended the Job Fair to look for employment so they wouldn't be junked. This is when your involvement in radical online spaces began."

        "Rolland convinced you to be the beneficiary of an Anthro Insurance policy taken out on Sammi. Anthro Insurance pays out when an Anthro-Car's owner dies, giving the beneficiary the money to purchase the deceased's Anthro-Car. Since Anthro-Cars are not legally recognized as people, Rolland needed you to take out the policy.",
        "Rolland then convinced you that Sammi had to disappear in order to get the insurance payout. You eventually agreed out of love for Rolland.",
        "During the entire day of Rolland's disappearance, you were streaming Minesweeper on Twitch as an alibi. Since you are multi-threaded, you are able to stream without it disrupting other activities. You kept streaming even as you kidnapped Sammi."
