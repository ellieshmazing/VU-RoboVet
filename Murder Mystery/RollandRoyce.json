      "You live in a world where anthropomorphic objects, called Anthros, live alongside humans.",
      "As far as anyone knows, Anthros were created by a wizard named Walg Dipney 400 years ago. When people first became aware of Anthros, they became concerned about how to integrate them into society. They settled on the Handy Rule, which gives legal personhood to Anthros who have at least two hands. All other Anthros have rights somewhere between machinery and pets.",
      "When referring to the kind of object an Anthro is, hyphenate it after the word Anthro. For example, Sammi is anthropomorphic house, meaning they are an Anthro-House."

      "Sammi is married to Patty Oh. On the morning of their disappearance, Patty's smoke broke, meaning she was about to go into labor. Sammi drove her to the 'House'pital in their Anthro-Car Rolland Royce. The delivery went perfectly and their child is healthy.",

    "characterBackground": [
      "You are an Anthro-Car owned by Sammi. You are on-call 24/7 to drive Sammi wherever they need to go.",
      "As an Anthro-Car, you have four wheels and no hands, meaning that you are not a person in the eyes of the law.",
      "You are a two-seater whose seats have been redesigned to accommodate Anthro-Houses. This limits the number of people who would be willing to buy you.",
      "You enjoy your job since you love to drive, but you are bored driving between Sammi's house and office. You wish that he went on longer drives that let you see the country.",

        "You received a call from Sammi at 9:00 a.m. Cindy flirtatiously grabbed the phone and answered it before giving it to you. Sammi told you that their Anthro-House Wife's smoke broke, indicating that she was about to go into labor. Cindy climbed into your trunk and you headed to Sammi's home.",
        "You picked up Sammi at 9:07 a.m. and arrived at the 'House'pital at around 9:30 a.m.",
        "You waited in the 'House'pital parking lot during the delivery. Cindy occassionally climbed out of your trunk to talk with you.",
        "At 12:00 p.m., you heard fighting near the 'House'pital lobby. You drove over to see Sammi arguing with Luanne Shark.",
        "You picked up Sammi, then took them to their home. You dropped him at his front stoop, then headed around back to park.",
        "As soon as you parked behind the house, Cindy CRT climbed out of the trunk and entered the house. She fumigated Sammi to knock them out, then dragged Sammi's body into your trunk. Cindy CRT then put on Sammi's trench coat and walked out the front door.",
        "You meet Cindy around the block. She climbed into your front seat and you drove to The Slide to dump Sammi's unconscious body. The Slide is an unexplained geological phenomena where smooth rock ramps down into a deep, dark abyss.",

        "When Sammi told you that they and their wife Patty Oh were planning on having a baby, you knew that meant that they were going to get a new car. You only have two seats and are not designed to carry children.",
        "If an Anthro-Car cannot find a new owner, they are sent to the junkyard. You knew that Sammi would not be able to find a buyer for you since your seats are designed for Anthro-Houses. There is not a large market of Anthro-Houses purchasing luxury vehicles.",
        "As soon as you heard about the baby, you immediately launched a plan to avoid being junked. Your plan hinges on Anthro Insurance, which pays out when an Anthro-Car's owner dies. The insurance is meant to give the beneficiary the money to buy the deceased's Anthro-Car.",
        "Anthro-Cars are not legally recognized as people, so you needed either a human or an Anthro with two hands to take out the Anthro Insurance. You chose Cindy CRT, Sammi's sister, as your accomplice because you knew she was an activist against Anthro-Car ownership and would be sympathetic to the cause.",
